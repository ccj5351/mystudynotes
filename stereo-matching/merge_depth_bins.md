- [How to merge histogram bins (edges and counts) by bin-count condition?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59590267/how-to-merge-histogram-bins-edges-and-counts-by-bin-count-condition)

# My answer to this question
I met this problem in my own reserach project, so I searched this question and posted my answer, hoping to help others and myself for reviewing.

- See [my answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59590267/how-to-merge-histogram-bins-edges-and-counts-by-bin-count-condition/70417945#70417945):

Assume the current histogram `hist` and bins `bin_edges` are returned by `np.hist()` function, and we want to merge small bins (i.e., the value of `hist` is smaller than some threshold) to larger ones, the code is shown below, where inputs are current hist and bins, and outputs are the new ones.

```python
def merge_hist_bins(hist, bin_edges, \
    hist_value_thred = 1, # i.e., 1% if is_percentile True;
    is_percentile = False
    ):
    total = np.sum(hist)
    if is_percentile:
        hist_thred = int(total*hist_value_thred*0.01)
    else:
        hist_thred = int(hist_value_thred)
    print ("[***] hist_thred = ", hist_thred)
    assert len(hist) == len(bin_edges) - 1
    bin_dict = {}
    i_rightmost = 0
    for i in range(0, len(hist)):
        if i < i_rightmost:
            continue
        edge_left = bin_edges[i]
        j = i
        tmp_hist_sum = 0
        while tmp_hist_sum < hist_thred and j < len(hist):
            tmp_hist_sum += hist[j]
            j += 1
            edge_right = bin_edges[j]
        else:
            bin_dict[(edge_left, edge_right)] = tmp_hist_sum
        i_rightmost = j
    
    idx = 0
    new_hist = []
    new_bin_edges = [bin_edges[0]]
    for k , v in bin_dict.items():
        new_hist.append(v)
        new_bin_edges.append(k[1])
        print ("key {} : {}".format(k, v))
        idx += 1
    print ("[***] done, hist_thred = ", hist_thred)
    print ("[***] old bin # = {}, new bin # = {}".format(len(bin_edges), len(new_bin_edges)))
    return np.array(new_hist), np.array(new_bin_edges), hist_thred

```

We will show the histogram with the following function:

```python
def show_hist(bin_edges, hist, fig_file = None):
    d_min = bin_edges[0]
    d_max = bin_edges[-1]
    d_num = len(bin_edges)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()  #create figure and axes 
    plt.hist(x=bin_edges[:-1], bins=bin_edges, weights=hist) 
    plt.xlabel('Value')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('My Very Own Histogram')
    # Figure size in inches (default)
    plt.text(x=0.5, y=0.5, \
        s=r'$D_{min}=$'+"{}".format(d_min) + r', $D_{max}=$'+"{}".format(\
            d_max) + r', $D_{num}=$'+"{}".format(d_num), 
        transform=ax.transAxes)
    if fig_file:
        plt.savefig("./results/{}.png".format(fig_file))
        print ("saved ", "./results/{}.png".format(fig_file))
    plt.show()
    txt_fn = "./results/" + npz_file + ".csv"
    comment = "#right_bin_edge, hist_value"
    file_lists = [ "{},{}".format(i, j if j > 50 else 0.5) for (i,j) in zip(bin_edges[1:], hist)]
    file_lists = [comment] + file_lists
    write_to_file(txt_fn, file_lists)
```

See the histogram before [![histograme before merging][1]][1]  

and after 


[![histograme after merging][2]][2] 


the bin merging. In this example, input hist bin # = 256, new hist bin # = 95, with the threshold being `12%` of `sum(hist)`.
