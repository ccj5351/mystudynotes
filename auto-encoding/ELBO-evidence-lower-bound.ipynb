    "LBO (evidence lower bound) is a key concept in  [Variational Bayesian Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods).

    "In this post, I’ll introduce an important concept in  [Variational Bayesian (VB) Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods)  — ELBO (evidence lower bound, also known as variational lower bound) — and its derivations, alongside some digging into it. ELBO enables the rewriting of statistical inference problems as optimization problems, the so-called  [_inference-optimization duality_](https://blog.evjang.com/2016/08/variational-bayes.html). Combined with optimization methods such as gradient descent and modern approximation techniques, e.g., deep neural networks, inference on complex distributions can be achieved. Numerous applications can be found in  [VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114v10),  [DVRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02426),  [MERLIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10760), to name a few.\n",

    "We are interested in finding the distribution  `p(x)`  of some given observations  `x`. Sometimes, this distribution can be fairly simple. For example, if the observations are the outcomes of flipping a coin,  `p(x)`  will be a  [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution). In a continuous case,  `p(x)`  will be a simple  [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)  if you are measuring the heights of people. However, sadly, we generally encounter observations with complicated distributions. The  figure below, for instance, shows such a  `p(x)`, which is a  [mixed Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#Gaussian_mixture_model).\n",

    "\n",
    "Similar to  [the law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability)  which relates `marginal` probabilities to `conditional` probabilities, we can think that the distribution of interest  `p(x)`  can be **transformed** from a simple distribution, let’s say,  `p(z)`. We will assume that  p(z)  is  [a simple Gaussian distribution](https://yunfanj.com/blog/2021/01/11/ELBO.html#fig2). Any other types of distributions can play the same role.\n",

    "Now we will try to use  `p(z)`  with some transformation  `f(⋅)`  to fit  `p(x)`. Concretely, we select several shifted copies of  `p(z)`  and multiply each of them with a weight  $w_i$. The result is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "Let’s define this intuition formally. Given observations  `x`, we can build a  [latent variable model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable_model)  with the variable  `z`  (we call it “_latent_” as it is not observed) such that the distribution of interest  `p(x)`  can be decomposed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "p\\left(x\\right) = \\int_z p\\left(x \\vert z\\right) p\\left(z\\right) dz.\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind Eq. (1) is: We condition our observations on some variables that we don’t know. Therefore, the probability of observations will be the multiplication of the conditional probability and the prior probability of those unknown variables. Subsequently, we integrate out all cases of `unknowns` to get the distribution of interest. In the above naive case, the shift means and those weights we applied correspond to the term  $p\\left(x \\vert z\\right)$, while the `transformation`, i.e., the summation, corresponds to the integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the convenience provided by decomposing a very complicated distribution into the multiplication of a simple Gaussian conditional distribution and a Gaussian prior distribution, there is a `PROBLEM` — the integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is  <font color='red'> _intractable_ </font> because it is performed `over the whole latent space`, which is impractical when latent variables are continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the above-mentioned intractable integration, another question would be that how to obtain a function that transforms  `p(z)`  into  `p(x)`. In other words, how to get the conditional distribution $p\\left(x \\vert z\\right)$. Despite that this function seems to be extremely non-linear, it is still not difficult to solve this problem as we know that neural networks are universal function approximators that can approximate any functions to arbitrary precisions. Therefore, we could use a neural network with parameters  $\\theta$  to approximate the distribution  $p\\left(x \\vert z\\right)$, which gives us  $p_\\theta \\left(x \\vert z\\right)$. In the subsequent sections, we will see how we can avoid the intractable integration and optimize our parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amortized Variational Inference and ELB\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters  $\\theta$  can be obtained from  [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation):  \n",
    "$$\\theta = \\arg\\max_\\theta \\log p_\\theta \\left(x\\right)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid integrating over the whole latent space, a natural question would be <font color='red'>  “Can we infer any information about  $z$  after observing a sample  $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$” </font>. The answer is “Yes” and we can use  $q_i\\left(z\\right)$  to approximate the distribution of  $z$  given the  i-th observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is the  [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference), `which aims to infer the value of one random variable given the observed value of another random variable.` Nevertheless, there is an obvious **drawback** behind this intuition. The number of parameters of  $q_i\\left(z\\right)$  will scale up with the size of the set of observations because we build individual distribution after observing each data. To alleviate this problem, we introduce another network with parameters  $\\phi$ to parameterize an approximation of  $q_i\\left(z\\right)$, i.e.,  \n",

This is the  <font color='red'>_amortized variational inference_ </font>, which is also referred to as  <font color='red'> _variational inference_ </font> in recent literature. Up to this point, as shown below, we have explicitly built a probabilistic graphical model to represent our problem where the observation  $x$  is conditioned on the latent variable  $z$  and we aim to infer  $z$  after observing  $x$.\n",

Samples drawn from a distribution with higher entropy will become more uncertain. Sadly, the entropy of the optimal distribution  $q_\\phi^\\ast \\left(z \\vert x\\right)$ we have just found is `negative infinity`. We can show this by constructing a random variable  `x`  drawn from a uniform distribution  $x \\sim \\mathcal{U} \\left(x_0 - \\epsilon, x_0 + \\epsilon\\right)$. Its entropy is  $\\mathbb{E}_x \\left[\\log \\frac{1}{p\\left(x\\right)}\\right] = \\log\\left(2 \\epsilon\\right)$.
