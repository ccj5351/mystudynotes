This is Changjiang Cai's study notes and blogs, covering several topics on compuer vision and machine learning, algorithm, and coding. I will make posts regularly.


## Website Style

This website style was inspired by several ones, including [ianwhitestone.work](https://github.com/ian-whitestone/ian-whitestone.github.io/tree/master), [Yunfan's Blog](https://github.com/yunfanjiang/blog/tree/main) and [Lil'Log](https://github.com/lilianweng/lilianweng.github.io). Thanks a lot for sharing! This website is powered by Jekyll and Github in order to render Latex equations correctly. 


Hit my [homepage](https://www.changjiangcai.com), [Github](https://github.com/ccj5351) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3z8yQkQAAAAJ&hl) for more details.



## Footer Icons
The 48x48 SVG icons of Google Scholar, GitHub and LinkedIn are downloaded from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com/icons/), and are saved at [docs/icons]({% link docs/icons/icons8-github.svg %}). The SVG images are changed to Base 64 CSS Background image using [this online tool](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image/svg0). See the format as this [css file](https://github.com/ccj5351/mystudynotes/blob/master/_sass/_svg-icons.scss) for more details.
