    "Consider a height-balancing scheme where following conditions should be checked to determine if a binary tree is balanced.\n",

    "\n",
    "The above height-balancing scheme is used in `AVL` trees. The diagram below shows two trees, one of them is height-balanced and other is not. The second tree is not height-balanced because the height of the left subtree is 2 more than that of the right subtree.\n",
