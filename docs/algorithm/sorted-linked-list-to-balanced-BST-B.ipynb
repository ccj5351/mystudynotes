    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The important condition that we have to adhere to in this problem is that we have to create a `height balanced` binary search tree using the set of nodes given to us in the form of a linked list. The good thing is that the nodes in the linked list are sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, a binary search tree is essentially a rooted binary tree with a very special property or relationship amongst its nodes. For a given node of the binary search tree, it's value must be $\\ge$ the value of all the nodes in the left subtree and $\\le$ the value of all the nodes in the right subtree. Since a binary tree has a recursive substructure, so does a BST, i.e. all the subtrees are binary search trees in themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea in this approach and the next is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> the middle element of the given list would form the root of the binary search tree. All the elements to the left of the middle element would form the left subtree recursively. Similarly, all the elements to the right of the middle element will form the right subtree of the binary search tree. This would ensure the height balance required in the resulting binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since we are given a linked list and not an array, we **don't really have access to the elements of the list using indexes**. We want to know the middle element of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can use the **two pointer approach** for finding out the middle element of a linked list. Essentially, we have two pointers called `slow_ptr` and `fast_ptr`. The `slow_ptr` moves one node at a time whereas the `fast_ptr` moves two nodes at a time. By the time the `fast_ptr` reaches the end of the linked list, the `slow_ptr` would have reached the middle element of the linked list. For an even sized list, any of the two middle elements can act as the root of the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once we have the middle element of the linked list, we disconnect the portion of the list to the left of the middle element. The way we do this is by keeping a `prev_ptr` as well which points to one node before the `slow_ptr` i.e. `prev_ptr.next = slow_ptr`. For disconnecting the left portion we simply do `prev_ptr.next = None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We only need to pass the head of the linked list to the function that converts it to a height balances BST. So, we recurse on the left half of the linked list by passing the original head of the list and on the right half by passing `slow_ptr.next` as the head."

From the looks of it, this seems to be an $O(N^2)$ algorithm. However, on closer analysis, it turns out to be a bit more efficient than $O(N^2)$.\n",

As we mentioned earlier, it takes $N/2$ steps to find the middle of a linked list with $N$ elements. After finding the middle element, we are left with two halves of size $N/2$ each. Then, we find the middle element for both of these halves and it would take a total of $2 \\times N / 4$  steps for that. And similarly for the smaller sublists that keep forming recursively.
